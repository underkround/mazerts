; moving concrete typ
;   int
;   concrete class to implement the moving:
;   1 - ground moving logic (only option atm)
;
; moving turning speed  --TODO
;   float
;   ???
;
; moving maximum speed  --TODO
;   float
;   ??? tiles per second?..
;
; moving acceleration  --TODO
;   float
;   ???
;
; moving passable treshold
;   int
;   just a reminder to move the treshold from terrain to moving.. maybe next
;   year or so :)
