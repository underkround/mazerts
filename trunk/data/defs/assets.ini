# Available assets in the game are defined here
# Note that "assets" refers to both units and buildings,
# and they are defined the same way.
#
# NOTE: I suggest that we keep the section names (which are id:s / tag:s
# to identify given definition) as follows:
#
# values   1..99  for asset definitions
#        101..    for radar defs
#        201..    for moving defs
#        301..    for projectile defs
#        501..    for resourcer defs
#
# agreed, ranges are totally overkill, but the point is to keep it "simple",
# and 10 slots for assets is not enough, 20 would not be so intuitive.. :)

; asset name
;   string
;   name for the asset to display in ui
;
;
; asset description
;   string
;   brief descrition, possibly tooltip, in ui?
;
; asset concrete type
;   int
;   This is the concrete class that is created for the asset
;   1 - unit
;   2 - building
;
; asset advanced
;   0 = basic unit
;   1 = advanced, requires science building to be built
;
; asset max hitpoints
;   int
;   maximum hitpoints, needed to reach before activation
;
; asset width
; asset height
;   int
;   height is ignored for unit-type of assets (since they are rectangular)
;    
; asset destruction time
;   float
;   seconds to be in destroyed-state before object delection and possible
;   explosion etc (TODO) event
;   atm this has no function =P
;
;
; asset construction cost ore
; asset construction cost energy
;   int
;   price of the unit when it's built
;
; asset idle energy consumption
;   int
;   how much does the unit consume energy by default
;   note that some actions may have their own power consumptions when active
;
; asset grid passable area x
; asset grid passable area y
; asset grid passable area width
; asset grid passable area height
;   int
;   only affects on buildings
;   terrain grid tile points x and y calculated from lower left corner of the
;   building (y increases upwards) and height and width define a rectangular
;	area that is left passable when the building is constructed. The idea is
;	that buildings which are entered and/or exited by units have a passable
;	area where said units can move
;
; asset grid entrance point x
; asset grid entrance point y
;	int
;	Only affects buildings
;	The x- and y-coordinates (calculated from lower left corner of the building)
;	where units can enter/exit the building
;
; asset XXX tag
;   int
;   id for components attached to asset. 0 for no component.
;   the value is a section name for the definition to use with the asset.
;   defs for each of these are in their own .ini-files.
;
; currently available components are:
;   moving      201..   only unit can have, makes it possibly to change position, doh
;   projectile  301..   things that can cast damage, launched by common weapon
;   resourcer   501..   resource; storing, mining, transporting...
;
