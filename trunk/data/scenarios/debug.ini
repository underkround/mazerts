#  * Giving 2 gives anonymous player (0) and 2 controllable (1 & 2)
#  * Controllable players start from 1
#  * player 0 for mines etc
#  * Player 1 is the human player, rest are AI players

# note: I know defining these with asset id suck. see defs/assets.ini
#       add optional support for asset names if you have extra time? ;P

; You need to define multiple assets as array to same key, since we
; don't have proper support for dynamic key name searching...
; Remember to set every value for every asset in right order.
