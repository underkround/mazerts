#### Mouse Configs ###

# keyboard modifier -values:
#  - scancode for modification key that is required to be pressed for the
#    action to work. 0 means no modifier key is required.

#  - mouse coordinate values for how much the mouse needs to move before
#    it is handled as dragging (below treshold it's click)
#

# this is added to the code in late phase, it's likely that not all
# settings follow this
